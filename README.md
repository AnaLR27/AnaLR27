## Hi 👋, I'm Ana.

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer. 

Currently, I am pursuing a **Higher Degree in Web Application Development** to expand my knowledge and expertise in the field of programming.

Previously, I completed a **Bootcamp in Full Stack Web Development**, focused on the **MERN Stack**, where I gained hands-on experience in building modern web applications.  

I also passed the [selection process (Piscine)](https://github.com/AnaLR27/42-Piscine) and joined the training program at [Campus 42 Málaga - Fundación Telefónica](https://www.fundaciontelefonica.com/empleabilidad/campus-42/).  

  
Here you can see what I'm working on:
- [My personal portfolio](https://alorenzodev.com)
- [42 Cursus](https://github.com/AnaLR27/42-Cursus)
- [Full Stack Web Aplication - MERN Stack](https://github.com/AnaLR27/recipes-project-MERN)
  

[[HERE]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4gviraDhts&t=2869s&ab_channel=CODESPACE) you can see the exhibition of our project on Hiring Day.

It starts from minute ***35:50***, previously the welcome screen is seen for those who entered the live. At minute ***48:00***, after my classmate's explanation of what we have done during the course, I show the functionality of our web application and at minute ***1:22:49*** I speak on a personal level about my part in the project.
